                Starting in 2006 we opened our first store in Costa Mesa, Paraguarí providing suits for business and special occasions. As our customer base grew and our satisfaction reviews increased, we opened stores in Santa Ana and Piribebuy. We’re now ranked among one of the biggest competitive suppliers for suits in the country.

                <p>
                We set high standards by ensuring the delivery of our products and the customer service that follows them. When walking into one of our stores you’ll be glad to know you are speaking to a knowledgeable staff member who has their own tastes and suggestions for fashion, design, and styles. We are delighted to be part of your shopping experience whilst providing you the best suit for any occasion.
